# Description

I'm learning Phaser and this is my sandbox. I chose to go with Next.js and while I found some helpful examples online, I'm making this public in hopes the patterns herein might help others. Together, the two frameworks work well, but some considerations need to be made with regards to Next's isomorphic nature as well as React's render cycle.

## Getting Started

```bash
$ npm i
$ npm run dev

```
